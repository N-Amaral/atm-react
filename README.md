Testing

# Setup

This project attempts to simulate a working ATM in Portugal as close as possible, including the obvious input limitations. This means it only registers click inputs on the on-screen keyboard and respective side-pad.

Made with Creat-React, TypeScript and Bootstrap 5

# Current Status

Currently setting up frontend side of things, as such, for now its only a hollow front, that recognizes inputs.

# Future Plans

Eventually it should fully work as a normal ATM meaning, deposits, withdrawls, account balance checking and obviously it should update everything. End goal includes a working way to create accounts to play around with in the project itself.
